After extended frequent use, the volume measurements on our Nalgene bottles started becoming difficult to read. In response, we created this svg file which we can use to restore the volume measurements by creating an aftermarket decal or sticker.

We're offering the SVG for this decal to the outdoors and DIY community for free.

## Description

This SVG file can help restore your ability to measure liquid volumes in your one liter Nalgene bottle. It is specifically measured for installation on the one liter wide mouth Nalgene bottles but may fit other models as well.

The file can be cut at home if you have access to a vinyl cutter.

## Formats

The template is available in two formats, both the same size 
- One with Cracked Asphalt attribution (free)
- One without any attribution ($1)

Use whichever you wish ✌️

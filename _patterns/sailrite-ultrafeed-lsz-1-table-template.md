# Pattern Overview

We spent hours and hours meticulously measuring and refining this template to take the guess work out of cutting and routing a hole in our sewing table. We hope you find it useful.

## Description

This template can help you to trace and cut the correct size hole in a table or other surface to flush-mount accommodate a Sailrite Ultrafeed LSZ-1.

This is a template to aid in sizing and cutting a hole in a table surface suitable for holding a Sailrite Ultrafeed sewing machine. Please note that this is not a physical product.

## Formats

The Sailrite Ultrafeed LSZ-1 table template is available in two formats
- Letter/A4 for print and tape at home
- Tabloid/A3 which will also work on a large format printer

Both are included in a single zip file.

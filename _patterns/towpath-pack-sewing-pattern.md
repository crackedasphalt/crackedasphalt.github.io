The Towpath Pack sewing pattern emphasizes clean construction and flexibility through material choice rather than excess features allowing makers to tailor their pack to their preferred carry style and level of internal organization. The pattern emphasizes clean construction and flexibility through material choice rather than excess features.

This pattern is offered in small and large sizes and is well suited for everyday essentials, travel use, and situations where you want a compact bag that stays out of the way.

## Carry Options

The Towpath Pack includes three distinct strap styles, each designed around a specific way of carrying the bag: 

- Wide, beefy wings webbing for a stable, traditional waist pack/fanny pack/bum bag feel.
- Narrower, sleek wings for a lighter, lower-profile waist carry. 
- Contoured, tapered wings specifically designed for crossbody or shoulder carry and helps the pack sit flatter against the body when worn across the chest or back.

Your preferred carry style is chosen during construction and all three options are included in one pattern. This approach keeps the design simple and extensible while allowing you to select the carry style that best suits your individual needs.

The Towpath Pack sewing pattern works well with a wide range of technical and pack fabrics, making it easy to adapt to different use cases without altering the pattern itself.

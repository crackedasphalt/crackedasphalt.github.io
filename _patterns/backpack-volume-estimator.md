## Pack Volume Estimator - Explanation & Readme

### What is this tool?
This Pack Volume Estimator is a tool designed to provide a **quick and reasonable estimation** of the volume of a backpack. Whether you're designing you're designing for MYOG or trying to get a rough idea of how much space your pack has compared to commercial models, this tool offers a practical approach to estimating volume.

Backpack volume is notoriously difficult to measure precisely, as it depends on how full the pack is, how much it bulges, and the irregular shapes of many designs. This tool applies two different volume estimation methods and averages them to provide a **close approximation** to real-world pack volumes.

---

### How does it work?

#### Cube Method
The simplest way to calculate volume is to multiply the **height Ã— width Ã— depth** of the pack:

<p>
  \[
    V_{\text{cube}} = \text{Height} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
  \]
</p>

This assumes that the pack is a **perfect rectangular prism**. However, packs are never perfectly box-shaped and this method does not account for factors such as rounded edges, tapering, or bulging that could affect actual capacity in real terms. A pack with significant tapering may have less usable volume than this method suggests, while a pack that bulges outward when stuffed may have more usable space than expected.

#### Cylinder Method
To provide an alternative estimation, we also approximate the pack as a **cylinder** with an equivalent circumference and height:

- **Estimate the circumference of the pack when fully stuffed**:
  <p>
    \[ 
      C = 2 \times ( \text{Depth} + \text{Width} )
    \]
  </p>

- **Solve for the radius** assuming a cylindrical cross-section:
  <p>
    \[
      r = \frac{C}{2\pi}
    \]
  </p>

- **Calculate the cylinderâ€™s volume**:
  <p>
    \[
      V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 \times \text{Height}
    \]
  </p>

Since cylinders maximize volume for a given perimeter, this method may sometimes suggest a larger capacity than what is actually usable. The assumption of a perfect cylindrical shape may not reflect how a pack fills out in real-world use, especially if it has rigid elements or is packed unevenly.

#### Averaging Both Methods (Balanced Estimate)
Since neither the **Cube Method** nor the **Cylinder Method** fully accounts for all possible pack shapes, we average them to get a practical, **middle-ground estimate**:

<p>
  \[
    V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{V_{\text{cube}} + V_{\text{cylinder}}}{2}
  \]
</p>

This approach closely matches commercial backpack volume calculations within a reasonable margin of error.

### Why is this method "good enough"? 

1. **Commercial manufacturers use their own proprietary methods** for measuring pack volume.
   - Some measure **fully stuffed pack interiors** using small balls or beads.
   - Some count **pockets and extensions** in total volume, others do not.
   - Different brands have **different standards**, so **no single method is exact**.

2. **Packs are flexible, irregular, and vary based on use.**
   - Your pack will hold **different amounts depending on whatâ€™s inside**.
   - Even with an exact manufacturer measurement, **real-world use varies**.

3. **For DIY & MYOG, an estimation is all you need.**
   - You need a **general idea** of the packâ€™s capacity.
   - Precision beyond Â±5% is unnecessaryâ€”a **ballpark figure** is more than enough.

This method strikes a balance between simplicity and accuracy, giving results within 5-10% of commercial measurements for most packs we tested.

---

### Assumptions We Made

#### The pack is roughly a rectangular or cylindrical shape
   - This method works well for frameless or lightly structured packs.
   - Rigid external-frame packs might have more wasted space than this method accounts for.

#### Packs bulge when filled, but not into a perfect cylinder
   - The cylinder method accounts for bulging that the cube method does not.
   - Most packs do not hold a perfect box shape when loaded.

#### Small external pockets are not counted
   - If you want to include side pockets, hip belt pockets, or lid pockets, add their estimated volume separately.
   - Many commercial packs include pockets in their stated volume (but not always consistently).

---

### Final Thoughts
This tool gives a quick, practical way to estimate the volume of a backpack. While itâ€™s not perfect, itâ€™s close enough for most MYOG projects, gear planning, and pack comparisons. The averaging method ensures that neither method dominates the calculation, making it a reliable, flexible tool.

If you need **absolute precision**, nothing beats filling your pack with small objects and measuring their total volumeâ€”but for 95% of cases, this method will get you within an acceptable range of real-world pack volume.

Happy designing! ðŸŽ’

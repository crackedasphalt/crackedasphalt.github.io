After what feels like an eternity of meticulous planning, designing, sewing, and documenting, we are beyond thrilled to announce the release of the Eleven Fifteen Daypack. Inspired by our dear friend Clare's love for exploration, adventure, and intentional minimalism, this 15-liter daypack is designed to be simple, durable, versatile, and perfect for daily capers.

The journey of creating this daypack began during one of Clare's and my cherished walks. As we wandered through fields and forests, our conversations turned towards our shared passion for making and for exploration. Clare's enthusiasm for a custom-designed pack sparked the creation of the the Eleven Fifteen prototype, and its success led to the development of this tiny little backpack.

## Concept and Design

The design philosophies behind the Eleven Fifteen Daypack are simplicity and pragmatism. With a capacity of 15 liters, it encourages mindful packing while providing ample space for essentials. Reminiscent of our favorite 1970s scramble packs, the no-frills enclosure ensures durability, while minimal pockets ensure versatility. Both are a nod to Clare's preference for timeless aesthetics.

The Eleven Fifteen Daypack embodies the essence of minimalist exploration, combining functionality with effortless style.

- **Streamlined Design:** Perfectly suited for everyday adventures and spontaneous outings.
- **Compact yet Spacious:** With a 15L capacity and intelligently designed compartments, the Eleven Fifteen accommodates essentials without excess.
- **Timeless Elegance:** A sleek daypack that seamlessly transitions from urban environments to natural landscapes.
- **Enhanced Comfort:** Featuring a breathable and adjustable shoulder straps for all-day wearability.
- **Travel-Ready Proportions:** Comfortably within most airlines personal item maximum dimensions.
- **Resilient Construction**: Crafted to endure the demands of daily use and outdoor exploration.

## Budget-Friendly Construction

The fabric and component requirements for this daypack are also minimal. We used a handful of fabrics and only a few components.

| **Material** | **We Used** |
| Shell Fabric | Approximately 3/4 yard 500D Cordura |
| Lining Fabric | Approximately 3/4 yard HyperD 300 |
| Mesh Fabrics | Minimal amounts of 1/8" 3D Spacer Mesh, Duraweave Stretch Mesh, 3.4oz Pocket Mesh, and a low stretch fleece |
| Padding | 11"x44" closed cell foam |
| Webbing | 5 yards nylon webbing |
| Components | Ladder locks, g hooks, cord lock, key hook, and a plastic grommet |

## Precision Drafting

The associated pattern for the Eleven Fifteen was meticulously planned and precision drafted from concept to creation. We used Valentina and a lot of trigonometry to ensure that every panel of the pack aligns flawlessly, guaranteeing a perfect fit and optimal functionality. Hours were dedicated to refining dimensions, fine-tuning seam allowances, and perfecting construction documentation to achieve a streamlined assembly.

Additional detail about the drafting process and some of the challenges we faced can be found in an [earlier post]({% link _posts/2024-04-04-clares-eleven-fifteen-prototype.md %}) about the first sample of this pack that we put out.

## The Final Product

The finished Eleven Fifteen Daypack is a testament to simplicity. In our backpack arsenal, it has already proven its worth through everyday use and outdoor adventures. From daily commutes to spontaneous hikes, it has become a trusted companion and one that I look forward to using daily and for years to come.

Filling a niche between our favorite 25-30 liter packs and a hip pack, we are extremely pleased with the size, the performance of the (very few) features, and the fit. Attention to detail during the sewing process yielded a far better outcome than I had expected. I'm particularly proud of the topstitching that is so prominently displayed on the lid and where the base meets the body of the pack.

## Check out the Pattern

We put a lot of time in to the pattern for this pack. So much that we decided to make it available to anyone who wants to use it. If you're interested in making a similar pack for yourself, the pattern is available for you to download at the link below.

Keep in mind that this pack embodies our design ethos rooted in simplicity, pragmatism, and user-centered design. It is not an appropriate pack for backcountry use but it does fill a very specific use case for our intended audience. For our use case, we think it's near perfect and we hope it finds a place in your gear closet too.

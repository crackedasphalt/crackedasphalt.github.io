If you're a long-time Nalgene user like me, you've likely also experienced the gradual wearing away of the volume measurement markings printed to the outside of your beloved water bottle. It's a shared frustration among users of this product. For a bottle as durable as a Nalgene, those markings sure do disappear quickly and especially when submitted to frequent handling, bug spray,  sunscreen, and other environmental factors that come with both daily and backcountry use.

This was such a common problem for my buddies and me that I spent an afternoon recreating the measurement scale and making a sticker of the graphic to replace the worn-away markings on my favorite bottles. The file I used is shared below for you to refurb your Nalgene as well.

The template is in SVG format and serves as a near-faithful replication of the Nalgene volume measurement guide. This template is designed specifically for the 1-liter Nalgene bottle.

I chose to cut this out in white vinyl on a Cricut that I have access to but I suppose it could just as easily be printed to clear sticker vinyl. If you get creative with this, [send a picture][contact-page]. I'm interested in seeing it.

## How One Might Use the SVG File

1. **Download the SVG File:**
   Access the SVG file below and save it to your computer.
   
2. **Create Your Sticker:** 
   Refer to the documentation of your cutter, printer, or other tool on how to prepare and send this file for cut or print. I chose to cut the sticker on white vinyl, you could just as easily print it on clear.

3. **Prepare Your Nalgene Bottle:**
   Ensure the outside of your Nalgene bottle is clean and dry before applying the new volume measurements.

4. **Measure a Known Quantity of Water:**
   Fill the bottle with a known quantity of water, using a separate measuring device to give yourself a point of reference.

5. **Align the Marking:**
   On an even surface and using the level of the known quantity of water in your bottle as a guide, carefully align the corresponding marking with the water level.

6. **Apply the Sticker:**
   Carefully stick the template onto the bottle, making sure it adheres securely and aligns perfectly with the original measurements.

7. **Enjoy Measuring Volumes Again:**
   You're welcome.

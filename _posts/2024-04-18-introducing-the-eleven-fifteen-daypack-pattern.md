After what feels like an eternity of meticulous planning, designing, sewing, and documenting, we are beyond thrilled to announce the release of the [Eleven Fifteen Daypack sewing pattern][download-path]. Inspired by our dear friend Clare's love for exploration, adventure, and intentional minimalism, this 15-liter daypack is designed to be simple, durable, versatile, and perfect for daily escapades.

The journey of creating this daypack began during one of Clare's and my cherished walks. As we wandered through fields and forests, our conversations turned towards our shared passion for making and for exploration. Clare's enthusiasm for a custom-designed pack sparked the creation of the the Eleven Fifteen prototype, and its success led to the development of this sewing pattern.

## Concept and Design

The design philosophies behind the [Eleven Fifteen Daypack][download-path] are simplicity and pragmatism. With a capacity of 15 liters, it encourages mindful packing while providing ample space for essentials. Reminiscent of our favorite 1970s scramble packs, the no-frills enclosure ensures durability, while minimal pockets ensure versatility. Both are a nod to Clare's preference for timeless aesthetics.

The Eleven Fifteen Daypack embodies the essence of minimalist exploration, combining functionality with effortless style.

- **Streamlined Design:** Perfectly suited for everyday adventures and spontaneous outings.
- **Compact yet Spacious:** With a 15L capacity and intelligently designed compartments, the Eleven Fifteen accommodates essentials without excess.
- **Timeless Elegance:** A sleek daypack that seamlessly transitions from urban environments to natural landscapes.
- **Enhanced Comfort:** Featuring a breathable and adjustable shoulder straps for all-day wearability.
- **Travel-Ready Proportions:** Comfortably within most airlines personal item maximum dimensions.
- **Resilient Construction**: Crafted to endure the demands of daily use and outdoor exploration.

| Lining Fabric | Approximately 3/4 yard HyperD 300 |
| Mesh Fabrics | Minimal amounts of 1/8" 3D Spacer Mesh, Duraweave Stretch Mesh, 3.4oz Pocket Mesh, and a low stretch fleece |
| Padding | 11"x44" closed cell foam |
| Webbing | 5 yards nylon webbing |
| Components | Ladder locks, g hooks, cord lock, key hook, and a plastic grommet |

## Precision Drafting

This pattern is meticulously planned and precision drafted from concept to creation. We leveraged a computer aided drafting software called Valentina to ensure that every panel of the Eleven Fifteen Daypack aligns flawlessly, guaranteeing a perfect fit and optimal functionality. Hours were dedicated to refining dimensions, fine-tuning seam allowances, and perfecting construction documentation to achieve a streamlined assembly.

Additional detail about the drafting process and some of the challenges we faced can be found in an [earlier post]({% link _posts/2024-04-04-clares-eleven-fifteen-prototype.md %}) about the first sample of this pack that we put out.

## The Final Product

The finished Eleven Fifteen Daypack is a testament to simplicity. In our backpack arsenal, it has already proven its worth through everyday use and outdoor adventures. From daily commutes to spontaneous hikes, it has become a trusted companion, ready to take on whatever challenges lie ahead.

Filling a niche between our favorite 25-30 liter packs and a hip pack, we are extremely pleased with the size, the performance of the (very few) features, and the fit. Attention to detail during the sewing process yielded a far better outcome than I had expected. I'm particularly proud of the topstitching that is so prominently displayed on the lid and where the base meets the body of the pack.

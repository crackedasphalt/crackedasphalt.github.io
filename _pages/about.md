## In the Beginning

It was 2020 and there was no toilet paper to be had. Worse yet, I was looking down the barrel of a summer indoors, travel out of the question, and more time on my hands than ever before in my adult life. I had been planning to make my own pack for many years after endlessly complaining about meaningless details of every pack I've ever owned--trouble was, I didn't know the first thing about sewing. The timing just made sense and I committed: I would learn to sew during 2020 to keep myself occupied. After a few months of scouring, I was able to source a domestic machine (super competitive in 2020,) ordered some technical fabric and fasteners, and got into a project way over my head almost immediately.

My intentions were simple at the time: a pack that fits and carries like a mountaineering pack, offers a single cavity into which I can stuff gear or clothes for a weeklong trip, and is made of textiles that are suitable to be dragged across asphalt and stuffed in the belly of a plane with minimal regard to whether the pack would survive. I quickly learned however that there are many, many foundational skills that are required to make this pack and it was going to be more than a summer project.

Three years now from conception, I've had the opportunity to make gear for friends, family, professional colleagues, and some strangers who I'll probably never see again. I hope to share what I've learned on this journey with you.

I'm still working on that perfect pack.

My partner and I have called the Lower Haight in San Francisco home since 2010. We both grew up in Western Washington in the shadow of _The Mountain_. We travel frequently and are militant one bag packers: 30 liters or less. Any more and you're carrying too much.

Things we love
* top-loading backpacks
* mission burritos
* window seats on an airplane
* our local watering hole
* hiking, camping, backpacking, swimming in lakes, and being outside

## Our Philosophy

* **Functionality and Performance:** Our gear must serve its intended purpose effectively. We prioritize functionality and performance to ensure that it meets the needs of users in various outdoor conditions. We test gear rigorously to ensure it can withstand the demands of the outdoors.
* **User-Centered Design:** We strive to understand the needs, preferences, and limitations of our audience. Where possible, we involve potential users in the design process and testing to ensure that gear meets their expectations and enhances their experience outdoors.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Our gear design process is an iterative one. We gather feedback from users and make improvements based on their experiences and changing needs. We strive to stay up-to-date with the latest materials, technologies, and trends.
* **Adaptability and Versatility:** Cracked Asphalt started in a one-bedroom apartment. Out of necessity, we create gear that can adapt to different outdoor scenarios and which can be used in various environments or for multiple purposes.
* **Sustainability:** We design gear with sustainability in mind. Where possible, we use eco-friendly materials, minimize waste during production, and consider the product's entire lifecycle. We reuse textiles where possible, and recycle where not. 

## Dedication

While I was growing up, Dad prioritized taking his boys to the woods and, from his example, I gained a sense of exploration. When I was very young, at least a few times a year, he would pack up the truck and haul my brothers and me on a trip up the gravel and dirt fire roads of the Cascades on a trip that we affectionately called Boys Weekend. Dad has four sons, my brothers, and Boys Weekend was a chance to let us run off some steam in an environment where taking risks was encouraged while Dad scoped out the primo hunting locations for the upcoming season.

As the boys grew, so did our ambitions in the outdoors. Boys Weekend evolved to section hikes on the Pacific Crest Trail, often with a weekend mileage north of 70. Dad showed us the ropes of winter camping, how to safely traverse a snowfield, and everything I know about cycling safely on the rural highways of Western Washington.

Cracked Asphalt is dedicated to you, Dad.

## FAQ

### Would you like to collaborate with me on a project?
Probably. [Hit us up][contact-page]!

### Do you make gear I can buy?
Not at the moment. If this changes in the future, we will announce it via our mailing list.

### What's with the name?

I grew up in the country and now live in the city. Cracked Asphalt represents the gaps between obligations of daily urban life that take me back to my roots: hiking, camping, travel, mountaineering, and cycling. It is named for the footpaths and bicycle lanes of the city that we hail from.

### Do you accept commissions?
Occasionally. Feel free to [reach out][contact-page].

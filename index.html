  Cracked Asphalt makes DIY gear for the outdoors, from deep within the indoors.
excerpt: >
  Born in San Francisco and shaped by small apartments, stairwell field tests, and a healthy amount of overthinking, our patterns and projects are designed for makers who live in the city but dream in topo lines. We hike mostly in our heads but we build like it matters.<br />
